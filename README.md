Pneumonia Disease

What is Pneumonia?Â¶
Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing symptoms such as cough, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Common symptoms of pneumonia include:

Cough: Often producing mucus (may be green, yellow, or bloody).


Fever: A high body temperature is a common symptom.


Shortness of breath: Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing.


Chest pain: Sharp or stabbing pain that may worsen with deep breaths or coughing.


Fatigue: Feeling very tired or weak.


Sweating: Profuse sweating, especially in fever.

The severity of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, and certain populations, such as the elderly, young children, and individuals with weakened immune systems, are more vulnerable. Diagnosis is typically based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination, and imaging studies like chest X-rays.

Treatment depends on the underlying cause of pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia is often treated with antibiotics, while viral pneumonia may require antiviral medications. Supportive care, including rest, hydration, and sometimes hospitalization, may be necessary depending on the severity of the illness.

Preventive measures include vaccination against certain bacteria and viruses that can cause pneumonia, practicing good hand hygiene, avoiding smoking, and maintaining overall health to support a robust immune system. If you suspect you or someone else may have pneumonia, it is important to seek medical attention for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
